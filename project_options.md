# Project Options

A list of project ideas that could promote RSS/ATOM usage.

## Browser development

Dedicate developer work to browser to make feeds visible again in the browser UI, and to provide a way to subscribe to feeds.

## Website explainer

Create a site that explains how feed files work and how to use them, for several use cases and for users as well as developers. The site could also showcase projects build on RSS, and additionally serve as a home for this initiative.

Note: There already exist sites that explain RSS, like https://aboutfeeds.com/ and https://mg.guelker.eu/saverss/.
